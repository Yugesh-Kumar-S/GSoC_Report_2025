## Project Overview

As PSLab transitions from a native Android app to a Flutter-based cross-platform application, this project focuses on developing and enhancing **core sensor modules**, building a **reusable experimentation framework**, and introducing advanced features for **csv data handling and visualization**. The aim is to deliver a cohesive, extensible system that not only replicates existing functionality but significantly improves usability, scientific learning, and mobile data workflows. Alongside sensor integration, the project will introduce a reusable experimentation framework. To support effective data workflows, the project will include functionality for logging, exporting, and importing sensor data using CSV files.
