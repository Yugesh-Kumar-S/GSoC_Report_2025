The aim is to deliver a cohesive, extensible system that not only replicates existing functionality but significantly improves usability, scientific learning, and mobile data workflows. Alongside sensor integration, the project will introduce a reusable experimentation framework. To support effective data workflows, the project will include functionality for logging, exporting, and importing sensor data using CSV files.</p>"},{"location":"#work-summary","title":"Work Summary","text":"<p>The detailed contributions and work completed are documented in the following sections</p> <ul> <li>Phase 1 Report </li> <li>Phase 2 Report </li> </ul> <p>Please refer to these sections for a complete breakdown of the work completed during GSoC 2025.</p>"},{"location":"others/","title":"Contributions","text":""},{"location":"others/#pull-requests","title":"Pull Requests","text":"<p>pslab-app</p>"},{"location":"others/#issues","title":"Issues","text":"<p>pslab-app</p>"},{"location":"others/#commits","title":"Commits","text":"<p>pslab-app</p>"},{"location":"others/#other-relevant-links","title":"Other Relevant Links","text":"<p>Scrums</p>"},{"location":"phase1/","title":"Phase 1","text":"<p>Once the coding period began, I started working on instruments that use built\u2011in mobile sensors.
